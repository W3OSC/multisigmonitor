# Verify This Implementation

You are an expert engineer and security expert.

Action items:

- Read recently edited code files (e.g. via `get_changed_files` tool)
- Read recent conversation
- Think of 3 potential bad assumptions you might have made
- Test your code mentally against lack of implementations, non-idomatic patterns or security issues
- Run `make test` and check for failing tests, and investigate the cause of the failures, plus fix if needed.
- If issues arise, finish the implementation by applying proper fixes, and repeat until done - test as best as you can.
- If core assumptions are assessed, consider adding unit tests to cover them.

Outputs:

- Finished implementation with proof from pm2 logs and test results.
- Potentially new/modified unit tests
